# CS450
To execute the program, simply type:
  gcc -o myshell myshell.c
  ./myshell
or, alternatively, you can just type
  make
which will do the same thing and execute some test cases

The test cases that I wrote are of good quality because they test sequential and parallel
commands both separately and together. I also have test cases that will account for
errors that might arise, such as the command ending in "&" or the command not making 
any sense
